* Fixed plugins not working properly on classes already instrumented by JavaRebel

2.0-M1 (3rd December 2008)
This version has too many individual changes to bring them out. Therefore we only outline the major goals. 
 * Startup time and performance overhead. 
   Performance was one of the main goals for this release and we have optimized or otherwise eliminated 
   most of the bottlenecks that made the previous versions so slow for some of the users. 
   There is some work to be done before the final release, but you should see a noticeable difference already.
 * Compatibility. 
   Compatibility was also a large concern for this release. We have devoted a lot of time to tweak 
   reflection and annotations support as well as integration with specific frameworks. 
   We also compiled an extensive test suite that should make JavaRebel work out of the box for most users.
 * Embedded plugins: Spring and Guice.
   We now support distributing the plugins along with JavaRebel instead of downloading and installing them separately.
   With this release we included Spring and Guice, so you should be able to load new components and dependencies
   without redeploying. More plugins will be included as they are stabilized or contributed.
 * Virtual classpath.
   Another concern for many of our users is configuring the existing build/deploy environment to make use 
   of JavaRebel class reloading. Not everyone can use exploded development and -Drebel.dirs have limitations
   in support of added classes and resource propagation. That's why we implemented something we call a 
   _virtual classpath_. The -Drebel.path property behaves similar to the -Drebel.dirs, except that instead of directories 
   you can add WARs directly, with EARs and more advanced options coming soon. 
   Virtual classpath will also propagate new classes and update your resources, like HTML or JSP files. 
   It does require some extra configuration so take a look at the configuration manual (Configuration.html).
   NB! Virtual classpath is only supported on Tomcat, Jetty and WebLogic containers in this release.    
 * Improved API.
   Besides the embeddable plugins we also now support third-party instrumentation. This will allow us to support
   e.g. AspectJ load-time weaving. Unfortunately the plugin itself didn't make it into this release, but since
   the required infrastructure is now in place we can release it retroactively as a plugin.

1.2-M1 (9th June 2008)

* JavaRebel SDK. The SDK has been refactored with added functionality for processing class bytecode and managing JavaRebel configuration.
* JavaRebel Plugins. It is now possible to register JavaRebel plugins that can make use of the SDK APIs to integrate with custom containers or frameworks.

1.1-M3 (9th April 2008)

 * All known issues fixed.

1.0 M3 (5th November 2007)

 * No more need for "-Xbootclasspath/a:javarebel.jar" if the name of the JAR is not changed. JavaRebel will detect if the name of JAR is changed and suggest to either rename it or add to boot classpath.
 * Major improvements in performance. Startup time should in many cases improve two or more times (if slower than vanilla JVM). JavaRebel should also no longer use CPU when the application is idle.
 * Improved support for anonymous classes. Since compiler names anonymous classes consequently, adding a new one may rename all the rest and change their super classes and interfaces. Now JavaRebel handles such renaming without problems. This feature is disabled by default since some problems have been tracked to it. To enable add "-Drebel.enable_anon=true" to the command line.
 * Update notification. JavaRebel will now notify you when a newer version is available. No personal information (not even the currently installed version) is going ot ZeroTurnaround. To disable the feature add "-Drebel.disable_update=true" to the command line.
